You can now start the broker by executing:

   "C:\jms\mybroker\bin\artemis" run

Or you can setup the broker as Windows service and run it in the background:

   "C:\jms\mybroker\bin\artemis-service.exe" install
   "C:\jms\mybroker\bin\artemis-service.exe" start

   To stop the windows service:
      "C:\jms\mybroker\bin\artemis-service.exe" stop

   To uninstall the windows service
      "C:\jms\mybroker\bin\artemis-service.exe" uninstall



c:\jms\mybroker\bin>artemis run

apache activeMQ and apache artemis are available at localhost:8161 --> admin & admin

In Spring Boot, this error may be caused by using activemq-pool, support for which was dropped in version 2.1. It was replaced by pooled-jms.

The following dependency

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
    <artifactId>activemq-pool</artifactId>
</dependency>
should be replaced with:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.messaginghub</groupId>
    <artifactId>pooled-jms</artifactId>
</dependency>

Use these pool properties with messaginghub dependency
#spring.activemq.pool.enabled=true
#spring.activemq.pool.max-connections=50
